🚀 Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest
🔍 What I Did:
I used Isolation Forest to find unusual data (anomalies).

It’s good at spotting data that looks different from the rest.

🛠️ How It Works:
I cleaned the data using pandas and numpy 🧹.

Removed spaces and unwanted data to make it neat 📋.

Put the data into a proper table format 🧾.

🤖 Model Details:
python
Copy
Edit
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1, random_state=42)
contamination=0.1 means: "I think 10% of the data might be outliers" 📉.

The model will look for those.

random_state=42 keeps the results the same every time you run it 🎲.

🔄 Workflow:
Clean the data 🧹

Train the model 🧠

Predict if a data point is normal or not ❓

Show result:

✅ if normal

❌ if it's an anomaly

💡 Extra Info:
If you set contamination=0.05, it will look for fewer anomalies.

The model picks random parts of the data to build trees 🌳 — that’s how it finds what’s “different.”

Let me know if you want to show this in a presentation or as a code comment too! 😊

✅ Ending Notes:
This project helps detect outliers easily and visually 📊

Great for spotting unusual activity or errors in data 🔎

Easy to update and scale with new data 📈

✅ Normal data is marked clearly

❌ Anomalies are easy to identify



1. ✅ Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python and pip installed first.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn


2. cd /ai-assisted-devops
▶️ Run Your Python File
Use this command in your terminal or command prompt:
python aiops_log_analysis.py

OUTPUT :

$ python aiops_log_analysis.py
